      The first and most importnat postion is the goal tender. They are in
      charge of blocking the puck from going in the net and stopping rebouds.
      They are the only positon with their own special equipment other than the
      ref and is arguably the hardest postion to play in the game.

      A defenseman supports the goalie and blocks shots on goal in the defensive
      zone. Defensemen also play an offensive role when their team has the puck
      in the offensive zone. They will be positioned either towards the top of
      the zone near the blue line, called the point.

      The center is the central attacker in hockey. They are usually the scorer.
      The center can move more freely than the wingers and plays the entire ice.
      They take faceoffs after every whistle and are generally the faster
      skaters on the team.

      The hockey wing has responsibilities up and down the ice. On defense, the
      winger's job is all about puck possession as well as shutting down the
      opposition's defenseman on that side of the ice. In the offensive zone, a
      winger will stay on their desegnated side and moved between the boards and
      infront of the net.

      In hockey, an ref is a person who has some responsibility for enforcing
      the rules and maintaining the order of the game. Theres 4 refs on the ice
      at one time and only 2 of them are actually referees. The other 2 people
      are called linesmen and are there to call off sides as well as support
      their refs.
